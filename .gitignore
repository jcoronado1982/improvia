# User specifically requested excluding things that shouldn't be pushed.
# We are only interested in pushing the custom plugin we developed:
# wp-content/plugins/sistema-pro/
# However, if the user initiated git at the root of IMPROVIA, we need to ignore the rest.
# To be safe, let's ignore ALL plugins EXCEPT sistema-pro:
wp-content/plugins/*
!wp-content/plugins/sistema-pro/
